The project generally follows the [Alfresco Coding Standards](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Coding_Standards), with a number of specific differences:
  * XML documents are to be indented using 2 (not 4) space characters.
  * Import declarations are ordered from most general libraries (e.g. built-in JDK) through to most specific libraries (e.g. other classes specific to the import tool).  Within this they should be ordered alphabetically, using the fully qualified classname (i.e. the classname including the package name).
