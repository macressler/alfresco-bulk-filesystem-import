If you need to clean up (delete) a large import for some reason, it is best to use the delete function available in the legacy Explorer UI, and turn off (uncheck) the "Execute Rules" and "Archive Nodes" check boxes.  This is recommended even if the target of the import was a Share site's document library.

The reason for this is that the delete function in Share (up to and including Alfresco v4.2) has a bug that will prevent it from successfully deleting large folder hierarchies.
